               <p>Climate change is affecting the earth and every living thing on it. The past five years have each now ranked among the five warmest on record. According to NASA, 18 of the 19 warmest years have occurred since 2000. The ocean is absorbing 90% of the heat being generated through climate change and During the past three decades, sea surface temperatures have exceeded the last century’s average every year and have been higher than at any other time since records began.</p>
               <p>According to NASA scientists the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century is due to human expansion of the "greenhouse effect". This is warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as  "forcing" climate change. The primary culprits are carbon dioxide CO2 & Methane CH4 and if we are to reverse the effects of climate change, we must reverse concentration of these gases in the atmosphere.</p>
               <p>This can be accomplished in 2 ways, (1) Dramatically lower our production of CO2 and do so quickly or (2) Find way to absorb vast amount of carbon and store those gases in a suspended manner so that they cannot escape back into the atmosphere.</p>
               <p>Partner with Planet Green and become part of the solution to climate change.</p>
               <p>On July 5th a team of researchers published a paper about reforestation on a grand scale and it was noted that this approach “has mind-blowing potential to tackle the climate crisis”.  The article was published in the <a href="#" class="green-text"><u>Journal of Science</u></a> and republished in <a href="#" class="green-text"><u>The Guardian</u></a> on July 4th 2019.</p>
               <p>The plan of Planet Green is to leverage human volunteers, financial donations, corporate rewards and city land pledges all on a grand scale and to incent people to plant trees, lots of trees with a per year goal of 10 trees per person, per year over the course of 10 years. </p>

                     <p>Every city will need a City Captain. The purpose of the city captain is to get the message to your city that we are here to fight climate change though the planting of trees. City Captains need to be able to attend city hall meetings; they need to bring this effort to the attention of the city mayor and the city planning commission. They need to ask the city to pledge land for this effort and follow up to ensure that this is done. City captains need to communicate back on what progress they have made toward the goal. City captains may also need to help coordinate a small marketing effort to local citizens so that they are aware of this climate change effort as well as where to buy indigenous trees.</p>
                     <p>City captains are volunteers that may be paid a small amount of money at some point for their efforts, but they should expect nothing in return. </p>

               <p>Once Walnut Creek has completed a pilot planting project our city should challenge our local surrounding cities (Concord, Pleasant Hill, Danville etc.) to participate and once a large number of cities in our county have adopted the plan we should challenge Alameda County, Solano County, Napa County and so on. At some point Northern CA should challenge Southern CA to participate and at some point, CA can challenge Nevada, Oregon, Utah etc. to all get in on the action. </p>
               <p>Recap: Climate change appears to be here for the long term and will impact every aspect of our lives. Solutions that are cheap, easy and quick simply do not exist. The carbon in our atmosphere is acting like an insulating blanket that is trapping heat which in turn is warming up the oceans and the atmosphere. Without massive action the earth will become a much more hostile place to live as the ice caps melt, the oceans rise and become infected with Cholera and Vibrio bacteria. Plants and animals that cannot adapt quickly enough will parish. And it will become increasingly difficult to grow crops and care for livestock.</p>
               <p>The answer could be that we discontinue our use of all fossil fuels, but this creates radical change that we are decades away from making and could have catastrophic consequences on our economy.</p>
               <p>Thankfully there are alternatives. We have the ability to plant trees which naturally absorb CO2.  We have the ability to fertalize some of the oceans kelp beds which might also assist in the absorbtion of CO2 although careful testing needs to be done first to ensure this is a safe practice. We also have the ability to reduce our reliance on fossel fuels and increase our use of renewalbe sustainable fuels.</p>
               <p>Tree planting allows us to naturally absorb billions of tons of CO2 and to provide for habitat for animals, insects and to provide a cooling effect for the ground beneath the trees. This is an extremlely low tech solution to a high tech problem.</p>
               <p><b>We hope you will join us a we begin to reverse the effects of climate change!</b></p>
